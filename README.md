Yoga Application
The Kindness Yoga application is a web application that is designed to give users the ability to pick areas of the body they want to do their work out to. Yoga is a spiritual and ascetic discipline that includes simple meditation and the adoption of specific bodily postures. Yoga is widely practiced for health and relaxation. 

Overview:

Kindness Yoga gives the user a selection of body parts on which they would like to work out. First, the user selects the total duration of the yoga workout. The user can add and remove body types to generate yoga positions on. After the selection is made, the user can select the “Generate Workout” button. Based on the user’s selection, a random selection of positions is generated and displayed in a chart to the user. What makes our app different, is that the user can regenerate their workouts and receive different random workout yoga positions each time the button is clicked. The user can regenerate their workout as many times as they like before they begin their workout.

Application Steps:

•	User selects total Duration of Yoga Workout
•	User Adds/Removes body type to randomly generate workout
•	User clicks “Generate Workout” button to receive custom yoga workout routine. 
•	User views the list of yoga workouts generated and has the option to begin workout or can start all over.
•	After the user has begun the workout, a timer at the top of the page counts down before the next workout starts.
•	The user has the ability to play/ pause music along with their workout
